## 🏁 Getting Started (Local Development)

To run this project on your local machine for development or testing, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/sriannamalai-jaikumar/devops-portfolio.git](https://github.com/sriannamalai-jaikumar/devops-portfolio.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd devops-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the app in development mode:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    This runs the app and opens it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The page will reload automatically as you make edits.

## 🧪 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
This command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for full control.
